/* DO NOT USE THIS .TXT FILE AS AN INPUT
*
* HOW TO USE GAME OF LIFE WITH A .txt FILE:
* The first line of the .txt file is dedicated to the row and column length. The first int will be the number of rows, 
* while the second will be the number of columns.
* To make your game, first fill your .txt file with periods (".") in a grid that matches the rows and columns of the .txt file name.
* Then, fill any of the tiles that you wish to be 'alive' with "█".
* 
* See the example below for what the contents of the .txt file should look like. A valid name for a .txt file containing that pattern would be myGrid4x5.txt
